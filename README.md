## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rounakraj8/portfolio.git

   cd portfolio/website
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

You can customize the sections displayed on your portfolio by modifying the `website-setting.json` and `myData.json` files in the project.

### Enable or Disable Sections

1. **Locate the `website-setting.json` file:**

   The file is located in `website/src/website-setting.json`.

2. **Modify section visibility:**

   This file contains settings that control the visibility of various sections on your website. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "homepageEnabled": true,
     "resumeEnabled": true,
     "resume": {
       "headerEnabled": true,
       "contactEnabled": true,
       "workExperienceEnabled": true,
       "projectsEnabled": true,
       "educationEnabled": true,
       "skillsEnabled": true,
       "languagesEnabled": true,
       "interestsEnabled": true
     }
   }
   ```

   - Set a value to `true` to enable a section or `false` to disable it.
   - For example, if you want to hide the `workExperience` section, set `"workExperienceEnabled"` to `false`.

3. **Locate the `myData.json` file:**

   The file is located in `website/src/assets/data/myData.json`.

4. **Modify personal and professional information:**

   This file contains your personal information, work experience, education, skills, and projects. You can customize it to reflect your own details.

5. **Save changes:**

   After modifying the settings, save the changes. The development server will automatically reload to reflect the updates.

   git add .
   git commit -am "change description"
   git push main
   ```
